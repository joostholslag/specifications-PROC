2+^h|*CONDITION_GROUP*

h|*Description*
2+a|Special kind of Task Group whose members are all `CONDITION_BRANCH` instances, each of which represents a conditional expression based on context variables. Member branches are evaluated in order, which enables overlapping conditions as well as a final 'match-any' branch with a test expression of `True` to be used if needed.

This structure is the equivalent of a programming if/then/else statement.
