h|*Description*
2+a|Special kind of Task Group whose members are all `CONDITION_BRANCH` instances, each of which represents a conditional expression based on context variables. Member branches are evaluated in order, which enables overlapping conditions. The final branch may be used as a logical else (i.e. 'match-any') branch with a `_condition_` of `True`.

This structure is the equivalent of a programming if/then/else statement.
