2+^h|*DECISION_GROUP*

h|*Description*
2+a|Special kind of Task Group whose members are all `DECISION_BRANCH` instances, each of which represents a distinct value sub-range, and which represent together the total possible range of values of the test expression.

This structure is the equivalent of a programming switch statement. It is processed in order, and for situations that need it, the last branch may represent an 'any value', corresponding to a final 'else' at the end of the switch.
