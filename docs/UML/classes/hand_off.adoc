h|*Description*
2+a|A kind of Task representing a hand-off to a different performer in the current Work Plan.

Tasks of the linked Plan become available to that performer, who is also alerted to start work.

A hand-off usually involves waiting with later notification (callback), or continuation. Waiting would typically mean the Plan execution engine places this Plan on a wait list, enabling the performer to proceed with work on other subjects.
