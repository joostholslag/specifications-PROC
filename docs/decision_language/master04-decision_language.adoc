= Decision Support Language

== Overview

The Decision Support Language is a high-level language in which modules containing the following elements may be written:

* _definitions_: domain constants;
* _conditions_: Boolean-returning domain-specified criteria;
* _rules_: domain-specified rules structures based on condition/action structures, which may return any type;
* _rule-sets_: related sets of rules in various forms, including decision tables.

An example of a basic DSL text is shown below.
