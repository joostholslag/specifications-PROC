= Usage

At least two usage styles between the Plan engine and the Decision engine are possible.

== Rule-based

In this style, rules are defined within the decision logic modules and the Plan just performs a 'switch' on the output values. This would be useful for non-Boolean decisions, e.g. generating coded terms; also for functions generating many possible values or value ranges. A DLM 'rule' is likely to be intentionally designed to reflect published clinical best practice.

== Condition-based

In this style, only conditions defined within the logic modules are called, and the Plan defines the decision structure, i.e. it is a novel or ad hoc use of existing conditions. Semantically the
