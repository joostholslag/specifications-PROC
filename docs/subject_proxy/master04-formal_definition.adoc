= Formal Definition

== Overview

From a data perspective, the set of features defined in an SPO will relate to a particular use. For example, the properties for a leukaemia patient are likely to include `white_cell_count`, `platelets` and so on, while a SPO for ante-natal use will contain obstetric properties. A core set of SPO features for any patient would include clinical basics such as date of birth, sex, and typical vital signs. In general, the collection of features in an SPO will be a somewhat arbitrary 'slice' of all possible variables and events characterising a real-world entity.
