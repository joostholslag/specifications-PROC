= Design Principles

The following sections describe the design key ideas used in the Task Planning model defined in this specification.

== Computational Basis

A basic choice in the architecture presented here is that it is executable in the sense of all elements used in creating Plan definitions have an objective computational meaning and can be executed according to defined semantics. The intention is that developing task plans is a kind of high level programming, performed using dedicated tools, and whose resulting artefacts are executable. This does not of course mean that the resulting system performs the work (although it may indeed perform some particular Tasks). Instead, it means that the resulting executable artefacts and application(s) when executed in a real world work environment that includes human and other actors, will convert disparate workers with weak communication and coordination into an efficient, integrated, whole.

This follows the YAWL (<<Hofstede_van_der_Aalst_2009>>) rather than BPMN approach, such that no Plan defined according to this specification has ambiguous meaning.

== Computational Context

This specification describes the models and semantics for task plans and their execution by a notional openEHR Task Planning execution engine ('TP engine'). This is assumed to operate in a server computing environment in which other systems exist with which the TP engine communicates. A key system is the openEHR EHR system, via which openEHR EHRs are accessible to the TP Engine. 

Outside of the environment exist other organisations with which TP engine communicates by generic means (ultimately, email, phone calls, etc), mediated by an appropriate communications / notification system within the environment.

Users who act as performers of tasks are connected to the engine via applications that communicate to the TP engine via the API of the TP Engine. These applications may be dedicated to Task Planning or a combined openEHR application context containing Task Planning components or forms. Users who act as plan designers are connected to a task planning designer system via a dedicated designer application.

The overall context is shown below.

.Computational Environment
image::{diagrams_uri}/computational_environment.svg[id=computational_environment, align="center", width=80%]

One of the major differences between the openEHR Task Planning architecture compared to other workflow architectures is that it can rely on shared access to persistent patient EHRs as the location in which context data can be read (e.g. patient variables) and in which records of performed tasks are ultimately stored, in the form of openEHR Compositions containing Entries, in the usual way.

== Conceptual Basics

=== Work Plan

The top-level formal concept defined is the _Work Plan_, which consists of one or more _Task Plans_. The Work Plan is a definition of work to be performed by one or more workers in order to achieve a defined goal with respect to a subject of care. Goals are often defined by published guidelines or care pathways, and the overall structure of work defined within a Work Plan and its constituent Task Plans may well be structured according to such publications.

Within a Work Plan, each included Task Plan is a definition of work to be performed in a single work _context_, by a 'principal performer' and possibly other participants. Multiple Task Plans occur for two reasons:

* distinct performers working in different contexts, across which managed _handoffs_ are required;
* _sub-plans_ subordinate to a parent Task Plan, to be performed by the same worker. 

Sub-plans occur to allow re-use of Plans for smaller pieces of work and also to provide a means of controlling the detail level of work differently for performers of different experience levels.

The entirety of the Work Plan definition is assumed to be executable within a single computational context, in which methods of notification and worker communication are available, enabling the state of progress of the work defined in the Plan to be fully represented. A Work Plan will often be limited to a single enterprise, but this need not be the case, as long as all of its Task Plans communicate within the same Plan execution context. 

More typically, some jobs required by a Work Plan are performed in another organisational context entirely, and from the point of view of the original Work Plan, the second organisation is seen as a 'black box' to which a request can be made and a result might be returned. A common example is a hospital clinical workflow that at some point requires a laboratory result, which is processed by an external organisation. These situations are handled by an 'external request' Task type.

=== Task Plan

The actual definition of work to be done, i.e. Tasks, occurs within each Task Plan. The most basic structuring notion required is that of a sequential list of Tasks, enabling the representation of the set of steps in a typical linear workflow such as making tea or cleaning a wound.

However, in the real world, almost every job can be sub-divided into smaller pieces of work in a fractal nature. This simple fact requires that the general structure of Tasks is actually a hierarchy, within which sequential Task lists occur commonly (and will be the top-level structure in simple cases). The formal construct provided for this is the Task Group, which may contain Tasks and more Task Groups.

With hierarchy and sequential execution semantics, a great many types of work can be represented. However, some sets of Tasks can be performed without regard to order - i.e. in parallel. The model defined here therefore includes an execution type indicator at the Task Group level, so that manner of performing the work items within a Task Group - with or without regard to order - can be indicated. In purely sequential Task Plans, there is only one _execution path_. Parallel execution enables the possibility of multiple execution paths during a Plan execution.

The power of the Task Group / Task structure can be significantly augmented in another dimension with the addition of conditions, to create _conditional structures_. These can be used to represent a variety of logical choice structures, equivalent to the following programming concepts:

* *if/elseif/else*: a standard multi-branch logic chain with any condition on each branch, evaluated in order;
* *switch*: a standard multi-way logic structure based on a single condition and branches for multiple value sub-ranges;
* *rule-set*: a typical chained event-driven rule structure whereby each branch is defined to fire on reception of a specific kind of event.

The leaf level constituents of a Task Plan are Tasks of various kinds, including inline-defined Tasks; requests to other contexts within the same Work Plan; requests to external contexts and requests to IT systems and services.

The Task concept defined in this specification is relatively straightforward in the abstract: it corresponds to a separately performable _item of work_ for a _performer_ to execute. A Task within a Plan has a lifecycle whose states indicate whether it is planned, available, complete etc.

In business terms, a Task typically corresponds to:

* an explicit level of clinical responsibility, e.g. nurse administration of a drug, single observation of patient vital sign etc;
* an explicit level of re-imbursement / billing;
* granularity of check-list and protocol single items, designed to be signed off as performed;
* a particular planned time of execution.

We can summarise the above-described structure in reverse:

* *Task*: a separately performable unit of planned work at any level of granularity; may be defined inline or 
* *Task Group*: a group of Tasks and/or more Task Groups within a Task Plan that are to be executed on the same basis, e.g. sequential, parallel.
* *conditional Group types*: special kinds of Task Group that enable conditional logic structures to be represented in a Plan.
* *Task Plan*: a logical set of Tasks for a single performer context to achieve a defined result within a larger plan.
* *Work Plan*: top-level structure containing related Task Plans needed to implement an intended outcome for a subject of care.

=== Graph Structure

The Task Group construct replaces the node references found in traditional workflow formalisms such as BPMN, and defines the static graph structure of the 'normal flow' of a Task Plan _by implication_. Only exceptions to the normal flow are represented with explicit node references.

This provides significantly more power than an explicit graph structure for the normal flow, since Task Groups can have _rules_ attached to them indicating which members should be executed and when, rather than relying on explicit links. The sequential / parallel indicator is one such simple rule. Additional rules could be added, such as:

* at least N members must complete for group to complete
* exit group on first succeeding task

These more sophisticated rules are represented in a generic way, with the Task Plan engine assumed to implement the underlying mechanics.

=== Work Context

A fundamental concept in this specification is that of _work context_, which is the factor that distinguishes one Task Plan from another, i.e. one Plan corresponds to Tasks to be performed in a single work context. Work context is defined as a single, _contiguous cognitive flow_ in the real world (i.e. not in the computational representation, which must always be considered an approximation updated in snapshot fashion) in which work can be performed _seamlessly_ by one or more performers on a single subject. Concretely, this means that the flow of cognitive activity is unbroken during the work. This may extend over time and even distinct physical spaces, such as in the case of tele-consultations. Normally a single cognitive flow corresponds to a single actor, usually a person, but this is not always the case. More than one person may be involved in performing work on the same subject, but essentially working as one, and relying on real-time verbal or other communication to achieve the effect of a _single mind_.

Continuous knowledge of the work, and continuous real-time communication with oneself ('train of thought') or directly among multiple performers is what characterises a given context. A different context is one with different cognitive actors, and with which communications is performed by notifications at certain time checkpoints, typically just the beginning and end.

Since parallelism is possible within a single Plan, a performer may be working on more than one thing at once, within the same context. In other words, a work context (and a Task Plan in execution) may contain multiple execution paths at a point in time.

=== Context Switching and Forking

If work has to be stopped within one context and passed to a different work context, a _context switch_ is required, and the first worker or team will wait for a response. If the context switch is within the same Work Plan, is termed a _handoff_, which entails switching Task Plans. A context change is also required to request work from an external environment. A second kind of change of control is a _context fork_, whereby the current performer signals to another context to start doing some work, but continues doing his own work. 

A context switch is commonly known as 'block and wait' or 'synchronous processing', while the context fork is known as 'asynchronous' or 'parallel' processing.

Work context is clearly maintained during a 'working session' during which the work is done by one or more performers. But if the work extends over hours or days, as in the case of chemotherapy, worker shifts will end and the work will be taken up by new workers, or perhaps the same workers on the next day. The Task Planning model does not consider this kind of _handoff_ to be a context switch, since it is assumed that the Task Planning runtime system maintains all relevant context information, available for use by new workers. All that is required to maintain the context is for de-allocation and re-allocation of the work to performers.

The following diagram shows the taxonomy of task types.

.Task Taxonomy
image::{diagrams_uri}/task_taxonomy.svg[id=task_taxonomy, align="center", width=50%]

=== Principal Performer

Following the definition of context above, a Task Plan is defined to have a _principle performer_, that is to say, a single logical executing actor. This is often a single person (or a device or possibly a software service), but might equally be a group of personnel, e.g. ward nurses, who execute the steps of a Task Plan during and across shift boundaries (wound dressing, turning patients, IV maintenance etc). In these cases the separate individuals constitute a 'single mind' as described above, with respect to the subject of care and the work, and their communication is not directly represented within the Task Plan.

In addition to the principal performer, other participations can be specified for any contained Task in a Plan. This allows the Plan to indicate where specific members working in a single context should be responsible for specific individual Tasks. However it is assumed that the principal performer is _responsible_ for all actions, and is also the notifier of action completions and cancellations.

The principal performer and other participants are specified in the Plan in terms of professional roles, and optionally a specific agent. This might in some cases be the patient.

Where an overall work plan requires separate actors who do not operate within the same work context, e.g. the various specialists and other professionals who perform different tasks with respect to an acute stroke patient, separate Task Plans each with their own principal performers are required. In this situation, coordination between the various actors is achieved by context switching and notification.

During the execution of a Task Plan, at any given time, a particular physical actor must be _assigned_ as the principal performer, in order for the Plan to proceed. This assignment will change over time for long-running Plans, due to shift changes, out of hours contacts, worker vacations and so on. In this model, worker changes are handled by runtime _allocation_ and are not treated as context switches. The allocation concept is described in more detail below.

[[time_and_wait_states]]
=== Time and Wait States

Many tasks in the real world can only be performed when certain events occur or conditions become true. This model treats such conditions as wait states, based on events or time.

Time is understood in three possible ways:

* as a _relative offset_ from the start of the Plan timeline, when it is activated;
* as an _absolute time_ as marked on a calendar;
* as the _time of an event_.

The first two are converted to events by the execution system internal clock reaching markers on the timeline or calendar. For event-based times, the kinds of events recognised include the following:

* _timer event_: an event caused by a timer that expires;
* _state trigger_: a condition based on one or more watched variables available from the computation environment, including subject variables (sex, vital signs, etc) and variables relating to clinical processes, e.g. 'time since emergency admission'.
* _task transition_: an event generated by the state transition of a Task during execution so far, e.g. the previous Task completing;
* _callback notification_: an event generated by a notification received on completion of a Task dispatched to a different Plan or an external system;
* _system notification_: an external event is notified to the system by a user, e.g. receipt of a phone call.
* _manual notification_: an external event is signalled manually to the system by a user, e.g. receipt of a phone call.

Tasks can be defined to wait on either one or more events. 

== Levels of Definition and Representation

Task Plans are defined, refined and used in various phases in time. A number of related technical representations are used, each appropriate to its phase.

                                                      represent R-CHOP protocols; an even more specialised one may represent a particular institution's
                                                      form of this protocol.

|===

In this scheme, archetype- and template-based modelling is used as much as possible in order to create layers of re-usable models that are progressively more specialised, until close-to-patient models are achieved, typically as templates. This enables the power of the archetype modelling formalism, including specialisation and composition to be used freely, in a similar manner to an object-oriented programming environment.

=== Separation of Definition and Execution

According to the above, the concrete definition of a Work Plan is constructed in the 'planning phase' of clinical time, to define work _to be done_ in the near future, by the planner and/or others. As the work is performed, the results are documented with openEHR Entries, such as Actions and Observations. During the execution of the plan there is usually a need to track the progress of the work in terms of Task completions, cancellations, failures, abandonment and so on.

As per the above table, the model defined in this specification separates the definition of Work Plans from their executions. This is achieved via `definition` and `materialised` parts of the model, corresponding to the concrete definition and materialised phases described above. Instances of the former are used to represent the definition of a plan, and would accordingly be used by a tools designed for that purpose. Similarly, run-time execution tools would be built using the `materialised` part of the model, as well as the `definition` part, since the latter is referred to by the former.

It is the materialised expression of a Plan that is used to record all Plan-related actions by Task performers. This state may be persisted for plans whose execution takes place over more than a user-application session.

The history of actions on the Plan can be understood as a set of _transactions_ over time, and the model provides a third `history` part that can be used to efficiently represent this history, allowing it to be permanently recorded.

== Execution Concepts

=== Plan Execution Lifecycle

A Work Plan definition can be executed by being materialised. The model recognises three states in the execution phase, as follows.

* `materialised` state: after creation of the materialised Plan, the Plan may be modified by its user(s), and pre-allocations done of performers.
* `activated` state: the materialised Plan is _activated_ when the users want to proceed. Connections must be established between the Plan execution context and various channels or APIs via which performer allocation and communication can be achieved. Activation establishes the zero point of the execution clock, and will cause performer allocations and generate various kinds of notifications as time moves forward. During the work, Tasks become _available_ as earlier Tasks are completed or cancelled. When a Task is available to be done, the performer has various options, including doing the work, cancelling the Task as not needed, completing the Task, aborting it, and abandoning the entire Plan.
* `terminated` state: A Plan terminates when a path taken through the materialised Task graph terminates, either due to finishing, or due to abandonment at an intermediate Task. The Plan as a whole returns a termination status of success or fail, which may be used to control behaviour if it is part of a chain in which a context switch follows termination.

=== Allocation

Since a Task in a Task Plan being executed at runtime represents the Plan execution system's knowledge of some work being performed in the real world, a way to connect the Plan as it is in the system (e.g. as shown on a UI application, or via notifications such as instant messaging) to the real-world actors performing it is needed. Following YAWL, the architecture described here treats _allocation_ of work to a performer as a formal activity during Plan execution.

Conceptually, worker allocation is understood in the following way. Firstly, it is assumed that Tasks can be allocated to two types of worker resource:

* individuals, specified in the Plan definition in terms of role and/or function within _principal performer_ and _other participations_ e.g. 'cardiologist';
* a worker _pool_, i.e. group of equivalent workers, e.g. nurses on a particular ward; here, any one of the workers can perform a given Task, and the workers may swap over time.

Secondly, at runtime, the actual worker will be resolved at execution time as follows:

* the Plan or Task is _assigned_ to a real individual or worker pool;
* an appropriate worker _claims_ a Plan (if Plans are posted somewhere, awaiting workers) or _accepts_ the Task (if Plan invitations are sent to individuals).

It remains the business of the organisation and also the Task Planning engine to resolve how these choices are made.

As per YAWL, more sophisticated implementations of Task Planning may offer numerous allocation strategies, such as first-available, quickest-to-complete, least-frequently-used and so on.

=== Task Lifecycle

Every Task in a Plan has a lifecycle described by a state machine. The states represent the state of a real world item of work, _as known by the Plan execution system_; setting them is entirely reliant on the system receiving input from performers. The successful execution path is through the states `planned` => `available` => `completed`, with other terminal states `cancelled` and `aborted` available for cases where a Task is cancelled and aborted respectively. Here, `cancelled` means 'not needed', i.e. the principal performer determined Task could be cancelled before or during execution, without compromising the Plan. Conversely, the `aborted` state indicates that the performer cannot do or complete the Task, or the rest of the Plan. Thus, `aborted` for a Task means abandonment of the current Plan.

From the viewpoint of Plan execution, the final state of a Task execution determines whether the Plan remaints in the `active` state, or whether it enters the `terminated` state. If the Task terminates with `completed` or `cancelled` state, it is considered to have _succeeded_, and the Plan remains `active`. If the Task is `aborted`, it is considered as _failed_, and the Plan terminates with a failure status.

A special transition `_override_` is used to force a Task to into the `available` state; this represents a performer explicitly overriding preconditions or subject preconditions.

=== Availability

A Task becomes _available_ to perform when three kinds of condition are met: 

* Execution control flow reaches the Task;
* External precondition, if any, is met;
* Subject preconditions if any, are met.

Control flow reaches a Task in a Plan when either preceding Tasks have been performed (local control flow) or a previously dispatched external Task completes, whose restart location in the current Plan is the current Task.

External preconditions (described above) are met when a point in clock time is reached or an event notification is received.

If the control flow and external preconditions are met, a Task will still not be available until any subject-related preconditions are satisfied. These are conditions that may be specified to ensure the Task is only performed if it is clinically appropriate and safe to do so, such as 'systolic blood pressure < 160 mmHg'.

Since the Task Plan cannot presume to have perfect knowledge of the real world situation, the performer is always allowed to override the external and subject pre-conditions, due to better knowledge. In such cases, the control flow requirement still holds - since this can already be 'overridden' by the performing cancelling preceding Tasks where appropriate.

When a Task does become available for execution, nothing will happen until a performer is allocated to do it. When an available worker is allocated, the Task may be commenced, and further life-cycle states can be reached, i.e. `completed`, `aborted` etc.

The following diagram illustrates these concepts.

=== Adaptive Modification and Exception-handling

One of the major challenges for any workflow system is that of being able to handle unplanned exceptions at runtime and adapt. The Task Planning model makes a key assumption that simplifies deviations at runtime, which is that the human (or other) performer always knows best. This means that Tasks posted to be done by the system are always advisory, and their details (such as time) are advisory. Accordingly, the model provides the following support for execution-time adaption:

* _logical deletion_: Tasks can be skipped by two types of cancellation in the lifecycle: `cancelled` (not needed) and `aborted` (abandon plan); if `cancelled` is used, this has the benign effect of skipping past a Task;
* _logical addition_: work items that are not represented as Tasks in a Task Plan can always be done, such as making extra patient observations or performing unplanned patient actions (e.g. refit a catheter, change a dressing); in openEHR they will always be recorded in the normal manner via Observation and Action Entries;
* _overrides_: various aspects of a Plan definition can be overridden at runtime, such as Task execution time and subject preconditions (such as BP < 160 mm[Hg]). Override is represented in the system as an alternative lifecycle transition that puts a Task into the `available` state even if not all conditions have been met for availability.

== Relationship of Task Plans with existing openEHR Entry Types

Within the phases of clinical planning and execution time described above, the Task Plan is not the only information artefact that may be created. The existing openEHR model `ENTRY` types provide the standard way to represent orders, via `INSTRUCTION`, and order-related performed activities, via `ACTION`. In addition, the usual `OBSERVATION`, `EVALUATION` and `ADMIN_ENTRY` types are used to record observations, diagnoses, and administrative events as they occur in clinical time. In abstract terms, Instructions may be understood as formal statements of 'what is to be done', and the other types, as records of 'what was done'. However, Instructions are most suited to concise representations of orderable actions, particularly medication administration, but not for general purpose detailed plans of events. The addition of Task Plans provides a way to specify such plans more flexibly, and in a step-by-step manner.

Both Instructions and Plans may be fully or partially defined by care pathways and/or guidelines, equally, they may be ad hoc developed in the 'old school medicine' sense. The following figure illustrates the relationships among care pathways, the existing openEHR Entry types and Task Plans. 

[.text-center]
.openEHR Planning Artefact Relationships

In simple cases, a Task Plan may just be the list of Tasks to fulfill one order, i.e. a single `INSTRUCTION` prescribing a course of antibiotics. The general case however is that the Task Plan corresponds to a clinical goal which implicates multiple orders, such as the CHOP chemotherapy mentioned above. 

Consequently, _not every Task in a Task Plan is associated with an order_, illustrated by the yellow Task objects in the above figure. While a typical case is that a Task corresponds to an openEHR `ACTION` that has not yet been recorded (and which normally has a driving `INSTRUCTION`), it may also correspond to an `ACTION` that has no `INSTRUCTION` or indeed an `OBSERVATION` or possibly an `EVALUATION` (perhaps some kind of check during a procedure). Indeed, there is also no reason why a Task Plan cannot consist of Tasks that define administrative work and would be documented with openEHR `ADMIN_ENTRYs`.

We can infer from the above that the main driver of a Task Plan isn't in general an order, but a care plan or guideline that usually includes orders, or else plain old ad hoc planning.

A high-level view of how clinical work generates openEHR information can be visualised conceptually with a modified version of the {openehr_rm_ehr}#_information_ontology[Clinical Investigator process diagram] as follows:

According to this scheme, `TASK_PLAN` and `TASK` are new types of information that can be committed to the EHR.

== Order Semantics versus Plan Semantics

Despite the above explanation, the difference between Instructions (as defined in openEHR) and Task Plans may not be completely clear. However, there is a key difference, which is the semantic level at which the two are expressed. A typical order, represented in an openEHR `INSTRUCTION` has an _algorithmic_ form, such as  "Amoxicillin 3 times a day, orally, for 7 days". Although healthcare professionals do not typically think about it, this expression is in fact a small program that is mentally _interpreted_ to produce resultant actions such as giving one tablet at 9:15 am, one at lunch and so on.

We can think of a Task Plan for ordered actions as the interpreted form of the original order statement(s), that is to say, a completely 'unfolded' list of single Tasks in time such as 'give 1 Amoxycillin oral tab at lunch'. This is a form suitable for displaying on work lists, checking off and ensuring no mistakes are made. When a Task is performed, it will still give rise to the appropriate openEHR Entry recording the details, such as 'gave 1 Amoxycillin tab at 13:37'.
