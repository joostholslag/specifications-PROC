= Task Planning Model Overview

This section and the following one describe the Task Planning model in technical detail. Most of the emphasis is on the 'definition' level of expression, with most details of the 'materialised' and 'runtime' expressions left to implementers. Throughout these sections, a version of the {openehr_tp_vml}[Task Planning Visual Modelling Language (TP-VML)^] is used to illustrate instance structures. This visual language is designed to be formally aligned to the semantics of the model.

The following UML diagram shows the `rm.task_planning` package in overview form, showing the constituent packages, `definition`, `materialised`, and `history`. The first of these packages contains the class model for the _definition model_ expression of a Work Plan, i.e. the workflow structure intentionally designed to achive a goal.

The `materialised` package contains the class model of the materialised form of the definition, which is created prior to its use in execution. The materialised model is presented in outline only, as a way of indicating some of the general features of the materialised form, and is not intended to be normative. (At some point in the future, a skeleton materialised model may be declared normative, based on implementation experience).

The `history` package contains the model of audit events that have occurred to each Task Plan in a Work Plan during execution.

The following instance diagram illustrates the relationships among these models for one Task Plan. On the left is a Task Plan definition, consisting of a Task Group and various Defined Actions. Each of these Tasks may have a prototype Entry attached, which represents the intended data of an Action, Observation or other Entry that the Task defines.

In the centre is a materialised Task Plan, which is an execution-time structure used to maintain state for an executing Plan. This structure allows the representation of all state to do with Plan execution, including instances of variables, timing information and so on. The materialised structure is not owned by the definition structure, but rather is created at run time, and points back to its definition via various references. The right hand side of the diagram shows a part of the materialised structure that is currently instantiated within a user-application session.

At the lower right is a Task Plan Execution History, which is a record of all events that were made during the execution of the original Task Plan.

== Identification and Referencing

With a Task Plan, various elements need to be referenceable at runtime. Tasks and Task Groups are identified via the `_uid_` attribute inherited from `LOCATABLE` via `PLAN_ITEM`, and which is populated with a Guid. References to a Task or Task Group are thus achieved with `UID_BASED_ID` instances carrying a Guid.

== Plan Data Context

[.tbd]
TBD: this section needs to be upgraded to latest EL and BMM model. The type `EXPR_TYPE_DEF` will be replaced by a BMM equivalent.

A Task Plan may contain logical _symbolic values_ of various kinds, including _constants_, _variable references_ and _expressions_, which are used in within the Plan structure. These are globally collated and tracked at runtime at the Work Plan level, i.e. in common to all Task Plans. Each context value has a symbolic name (`CONTEXT_VALUE._name_`), a type from within the openEHR type system (`EXPR_TYPE_DEF`).
The following UML diagram illustrates. 

[.text-center]
.Task planning - context values
image::{uml_diagrams_uri}/PROC-task_planning.definition-context.svg[id=proc_task_planning_context, align="center"]

An instance of `PLAN_DATA_CONTEXT` represents the full set of tracked variables and expressions used in a Work Plan, which are either  atomic _variables_ or _constants_, or else _expressions_ that reference such variables, respectively represented by the classes `CONTEXT_VARIABLE<T>`, `CONTEXT_CONSTANT<T>` and `CONTEXT_EXPRESSION<T>`. These classes and the abstract parent are generic, with the parameter being the formal type of variable or expression.

Context variables are typically related to subject state, such as patient vital signs, key demographic characteristics and so on, or the clinical care process, such as the 'time since stroke event', while expressions are used to represent logical expressions such as `$bp_systolic - $bp_diastolic`, where `$bp_systolic` and `$bp_diastolic` are defined as single variables. The syntax of expressions is defined by the {openehr_expression_language}[openEHR Expression language].

Two types of context variable are distinguished: external and local, represented by `EXTERNAL_VARIABLE<t>` and `LOCAL_VARIABLE<T>`. The former represent values of entities outside the task planning environment, and are written to via a `_populating_request_` which uses some method (such as EHR querying, API calls) to obtain the relevant external value. They are accordingly not writable from within the Work Plan.

There are two types of external variables - 'event' and 'state', which distinguish the update basis. An Event variable is 'watched' by some technical means, and its value is updated whenever it changes. The `CONTINUOUS_EVENT_VARIABLE` specialised type can be used for managing updates of continuous valued variables (i.e. real values) such that changes below a certain threshold, say 2% do not register.

Local variables are internal to the Work Plan, and can be read and written to by expressions used within Tasks in the Plan.

== System Calls

The `SYSTEM_CALL` class and its descendants provide a way to represent a call to any service or interface available within the computing environment. The class attributes are designed to carry sufficient meta-data such that a call invocation module or plug-in in the Task Planning execution environment can convert the call to a concrete form (e.g. a REST or RPC call) and then execute it.

=== Generic API calls

The representation of a generic API call is via the `API_CALL` class, while the `QUERY_CALL` class provides a way to represent a call to a query service.

For generic API calls, the assumed model of calling is as follows: when the call is invoked, all required parameters are passed; these are obtained from two sources:

* _context values_: context values, Work Plan built-in variables (see below);
* _fixed parameters_: parameters whose value is fixed from the point of view of the Plan definition.

The first is specified via the `_parameter_map_` attribute, which defines the mapping between the external call parameter names and the names of variables that will be used to populate them at invocation. For example, assume there is an API call in a clinical decision support service with the following signature, which is to be used in a Task Plan:

[source, ts]
----
    cds_calc_risk (
        riskType:    String;
        sex:         CodedText;
        dateOfBirth: Iso8601Date;
        isSmoker:    Boolean;
    ): Real
----

The `_parameter_map_` attribute of the `SYSTEM_CALL` instance will contain the following, where the left hand item in each case is the name of a Work Plan context value (i.e. variable, expression or constant):

[source, json]
----
    {
        "parameter_map": [
            {"context_name": "subject_sex",        "name": "sex"},
            {"context_name": "subject_dob",        "name": "dateOfBirth"},
            {"context_name": "tobacco_use_status", "name": "isSmoker"}
        ]
    }
----

This tells the Task Plan execution system to inject the current value of the context variable `subject_sex` into the location where the `sex` parameter is expected and so on.

[.tbd]
TBD: we may need to allow functions, so that data type/structure conversions can be managed.

The second type of parameter is a fixed value, which enables the System call to represent the external call in a preferred way. An example of this is a general API call such as `cds_check (type: String, other_args, ...)` might be used from within the Task Plan with the first argument fixed in each case, to form specific invocations, e.g. `cds_check ("hypertension risk", other_args, ...)`, `cds_check ("diabetes type 2 risk", other_args, ...)` etc. Fixed parameters are represented in the `_bound_parameters_` attribute of a `SYSTEM_CALL` instance.

The total set of parameters for any System call is provided by the combination of the contents of the `_parameter_map_` and `_bound_parameters_` attributes, where either may be empty.

=== Query Calls

The above provides for API calls whose signature definition may be more or less anything. For the case of query invocation, some simplifying assumptions can be made, and in the interests of clarity, the `QUERY_CALL` class is defined for this purpose. A `QUERY_CALL` instance represents a query invocation which is assumed to take the  form of either an ad hoc query or a stored query, with substitutable parameters. accordingly, the external API calls are therefore assumed to take one of the two forms:

[source, typescript]
----
    // ad hoc query call
    execute_ad_hoc_query (
        query_text: String;
        parameters: Hash<String, String>;
    ): Result
    
    // stored query call
    execute_stored_query (
        query_id: String;
        parameters: Hash<String, String>;
    ): Result
    
----

In the first case, a query string is supplied; in the second, the registered identifier of a stored query is supplied. In both cases, the substitutable parameters are supplied though the `args` attribute, which is a keyed list of `String` values that can be substituted into the replaceable parameters found in the query.

In order to represent an invocation of either of these calls, the `_parameter_map_` attribute is used to represent the map between the names of _the substitutable parameters in the query_ and variables from the Work Plan context. Since these are often likely to be the same (almost certainly the case for ad hoc queries), mappings are only required for substitutable variables whose names differ in the query and in the Plan context variable set.

The `_bound_parameters_` may be used in a similar fashion, to represent fixed-value substitutable parameters.

As a consequence of this scheme, the total set of replaceable query parameters is specified by the combination of the `_parameter_map_`, the `_bound_parameters_` and the context variables. In many cases, only the latter may be used.

== Variable Referencing

Within the expressions and System calls used in Task definitions, various variables may be used. These include the context variables described above and built-in variables defined for any Work Plan context, enabling the current Plan, current Task etc to be referred to, for example in a System call. The 'camel-case' and 'snake-case' variants of a variable name are treated as equivalents, i.e. `$var_name` and `$varName` refer to the same thing. Among the context variables, some standard defaults are recommended in order to maximise reusability of Task Plan definitions.

Within expressions, defined variables are referenced using the '$' syntax, i.e. `$var_name` or `$varName`. Within System calls there are two places where variable references may appear:

* within the `_parameters_` list, to indicate the mapping of a call parameter to a variable defined in the Work Plan context;
* as lexical inline replaceable parameters within a call parameter that represents an ad hoc query string or similar.

For the first case, the '$' name form is used. In the second case, variables usually appear within query strings in a lexical form that depends on the particular kind of query syntax, i.e. forms such as:

* `$var_name` - openEHR AQL;
* `@varName` - SQL Server, Oracle, PostGres 9 or later;
* `$[varName]` - some SQL implementations.

[.tbd]
TBD: do we need another property to record the type of query syntax, e.g. `'aql'`, `'oracle-sql'`, or variable syntax, since it is not a SQL standard?

The following table describes the variables available within a typical Work Plan.
